## Known Issues ##

These are some of the known issues in the current build of PinDroid.  Feel free to open an issue if you encounter a bug/issue not listed here, or have an idea for an enhancement.

  * Certain features from DeliciousDroid have not been ported yet due to limitations in Pinboard's API, including contact syncing and viewing network bookmark lists.
  * HTC Sense 4+ (Jelly Bean) devices have a bug that causes them to only display one share target per app in the stock HTC apps (Internet, Messages, etc).  As a workaround, there is a [standalone app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pindroid.readlater) to add the share target and forward it to the main PinDroid app.  Note that the main PinDroid app must be installed for this to work.
  * PinDroid can be moved to an sd card, however this will cause you to have to re-login every time you reboot your device.  Doing this may also cause widgets to not work in some cases.
